This project was develop with the idea to help people understand how the DIAN's form 210 works, how their values are calculated and how the final payment value generated.

> **Disclamer:** This project take in consideration the formulas described on the DIAN's form 210 instruction on how to use it, although their values ​​are quite approximate and it is carefully reviewed that their calculations are as accurate as possible, it is still a good idea to consult these values ​​with your trusted accountant, use at your own risk.
